    <h1>RSS headlines</h1>
<br />
<p>The RSS (abbreviation for <em><span>Really Simple Syndication</span></em>) is a news distribution channel 
        that facilitates access to the latest news of a Web site. It is a family of web feed formats used to 
        publish frequently updated digital content, such as blogs, news feeds or podcasts. <br />
        Users of RSS content use programs called feed "readers" or "aggregators": the user 
        subscribes to a feed by supplying to his or her reader a link to the feed; the reader can then check 
        the user's subscribed feeds to see if any of those feeds have new content since the last time it was checked, 
        and if so, retrieve that content and present it to the user.<br />
        This site incorporates this service in all the pages where&nbsp;this icon 
        appears <img alt="RSS" src="rss.gif">.
